# Minigame Examples

Here is a collection of projects I have written in Panda. Simply `cd` into one
of the above directories, and run the server from there. The proxy can be run
from anywhere.

For reference, here are the panda docs for the server:
[https://macmv.gitlab.io/bamboo/doc/sugarlang/bamboo/index.html]

The whenever you run the server, docs will also be generated in `./target/sl_docs`.
There will be an `info` log showing the full path to these logs, which can be
pasted into a browser to access the docs locally.
